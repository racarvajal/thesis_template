This thesis would have not been possible without the help of that
      person who bought all the food we needed.
      
      Part of this work was funded by the Big World Fund, which, in
      its second call, provided us with all the needed materials.
      
      This work uses data from our local library. We thank their
      kind help with the data we needed.
      
      This research made use of many different computer codes which
      we will not enumerate for space reasons.

      Finally, an important fraction of this work is based on \citet{1996ima..book.....C}.
